## 答案及详解
1. ✅ **I must water the plants.**  
   **解析**：must是情态动词，后面直接跟动词原形，不需要加to。

2. ✅ **It can't be Emily at the door - She's in Ireland.**  
   **解析**：表示否定推测用can't，而mustn't表示"禁止"。

3. ✅ **You needn't work tomorrow if you don't want to. || You don't have to work tomorrow if you don't want to.**  
   **解析**：表示"不必要"用needn't或don't have to，mustn't表示"禁止"。

4. ✅ **It may rain this afternoon.**

   **解析**：疑问句不能直接用may开头，应该改为其他表达方式。

6. ✅ **I felt very hot and tired. Perhaps I was ill.**  
   **解析**：描述过去的状态用过去时was，might表示现在对过去的推测不合适。

7. ✅ **I might have read what I liked when I was a child.**  
   **解析**：表示过去可能发生的事情用might have done结构。

15. ✅ **I'll phone you tonight.**  
    **解析**：将来时需要用助动词will或be going to。

16. ✅ **Can everybody park here?**
