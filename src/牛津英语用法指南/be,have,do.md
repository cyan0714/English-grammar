## 答案及详解
1. ✅ **I was very depressed when you phoned.**  
   **解析**：depressed是形容词，不能用进行时。be + 形容词表示状态，不用进行时。

2. ✅ **I'm not often sick.**  
   **解析**：be动词不与助动词do连用。应该直接用be的否定形式。

3. ✅ **There is a hole in my sleeve.**  
   **解析**：表示存在的句子应该用there be句型，不能直接说"A hole is"。

4. ✅ **There is a lot of noise in the street.**  
   **解析**：表示存在应该用there be句型，不能用it is。

5. ✅ **I don't know how many people there are in the waiting room.**  
   **解析**：there be句型中，be动词要与主语people保持一致，people是复数，用are。

6. ✅ **There was a girl swimming in the lake.**  
   **解析**：there be句型的语序是there + be + 主语 + 其他成分。

7. ✅ **There seem to be some problems.**  
   **解析**：主语是problems（复数），所以用seem，不是seems。

8. ✅ **The door was open.**  
   **解析**：这里不需要there be句型，直接说门的状态即可。

9. ✅ **Have you heard the news?**  
   **解析**：现在完成时的疑问句结构是have/has + 主语 + 过去分词，heard是过去分词。

10. ✅ **I haven't seen her anywhere.**  
    **解析**：现在完成时的否定句是have/has + not + 过去分词，不用进行时形式。

11. ✅ **Did you have a good trip?**  
    **解析**：询问过去的经历用一般过去时，不用倒装结构Had you。

12. ✅ **I have lunch at 12:30 most days.**  
    **解析**：lunch拼写错误，应该是lunch。have lunch表示"吃午饭"。

13. ✅ **She has three brothers.**  
    **解析**：have表示"拥有"时不用进行时，直接用一般现在时。

14. ✅ **Do you have a headache?**  
    **解析**：不能同时用do和have got，要么用"Do you have..."要么用"Have you got..."。

15. ✅ **'Have you got a pen?''Sorry, I haven't.'**  
    **解析**：have got的简短回答是"Yes, I have"或"No, I haven't"，不需要重复got。

16. ✅ **I got a cold last night.**  
    **解析**：表示过去某个时间得病，用一般过去时got，不用had got。

17. ✅ **You're right.**  
    **解析**：right在这里是形容词，前面用be动词，You're = You are。

18. ✅ **She's nearly thirty.**  
    **解析**：表示年龄用be动词，She's = She is。

19. ✅ **It weighs 37 kilos.**  
    **解析**：表示重量用动词weigh，不用be + heavy的结构。

20. ✅ **Do you like football?**  
    **解析**：疑问句需要助动词do，不能省略。

21. ✅ **Can you play football?**  
    **解析**：情态动词can不与助动词do连用，直接用Can you...。

22. ✅ **I don't like football.**  
    **解析**：否定句的语序是主语 + don't + 动词原形，not不能直接放在动词后。

23. ✅ **I haven't got the time to get the tickets. Who's going to do it?**  
    **解析**：第二句应该用it指代前面提到的动作"get the tickets"，不用so。

24. ✅ **I like the saxophone, and I've always done.**  
    **解析**：这里done指代前面的like the saxophone这个动作，不用it。
