## 答案及详解
1. ✅ **I was very interested in the lesson.**  
   **解析**：-ed形容词表示人的感受，-ing形容词表示事物的特征。人对某事感兴趣用interested，不用interesting。

2. ✅ **She has been put in prison for life.**  
   **解析**：现在完成时的被动语态结构是has/have + been + 过去分词，不能省略been。

3. ✅ **He was shot with a rifle.**  
   **解析**：表示使用工具或方式时用介词with，by用于表示动作的执行者。

4. ✅ **Our house was built in 1827.**  
   **解析**：在正式语体中，被动语态用was built，get built多用于非正式语体。

5. ✅ **The problem was explained to the children.**  
   **解析**：explain不能用双宾语结构的被动语态，应该用explain sth to sb的被动形式。

6. ✅ **A meeting place was suggested to us.**  
   **解析**：suggest不能用双宾语结构的被动语态，应该用suggest sth to sb的被动形式。

7. ✅ **I don't like to be shouted at.**  
   **解析**：短语动词在被动语态中要保持完整，shout at sb的被动语态是be shouted at。

8. ✅ **Stones were thrown at him. 或 They threw stones at him.**  
   **解析**：被动语态的主语应该是动作的承受者，这里stones是被扔的对象，所以应该作主语。

9. ✅ **Her mirror was broken. 或 Someone broke her mirror.**  
   **解析**：被动语态的结构是be + 过去分词，不能说was broken her mirror，应该把宾语作主语。

10. ✅ **Nobody thought that she was a spy.**  
    **解析**：复杂的被动语态句子通常转换为主动语态更自然，避免头重脚轻的结构。

11. ✅ **It has started to make a profit this year.**  
    **解析**：这里不是被动语态，start是不及物动词，表示"开始"，应该用现在完成时has started。

12. ✅ **His company is said to be in trouble.**  
    **解析**：复合宾语结构say sb to be的被动语态是sb is said to be，不能保持原来的结构。

13. ✅ **Everybody wanted Doris to be the manager.**  
    **解析**：want sb to do sth结构转换为被动语态时，通常改为主动语态更自然，或用Doris was wanted as the manager。

14. ✅ **I was annoyed by Emily telling everybody what to do.**  
    **解析**：将主动语态转换为被动语态，原来的宾语I变成主语，用be annoyed by表示被某事惹恼。
