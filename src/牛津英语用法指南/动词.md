## 答案及详解
1. ✅ **I lay down and went to sleep.**  
   **解析**：lay的过去式是laid，但lie(躺下)的过去式是lay。这里应该用lie的过去式。

2. ✅ **She switched it off.**  
   **解析**：代词宾语应该放在动词短语中间，不能放在最后。

3. ✅ **What do you think of the government?**  
   **解析**：think of表示"对...的看法"时，应该用一般现在时，不是进行时。

4. ✅ **I see what you mean.**  
   **解析**：see表示"理解，明白"时通常不用进行时。

5. ✅ **It is raining again.**  
   **解析**：英语句子必须有主语，天气用it作形式主语。

6. ✅ **Give me back my watch. 或 Give my watch back to me.**  
   **解析**：give back的正确语序是：give + 人 + back + 物 或 give + 物 + back + to + 人。

7. ✅ **Is that the light which you switched off?**  
   **解析**：介词短语不能分开，应该把off放在switched后面。

8. ✅ **You never listen to me.**  
   **解析**：listen是不及物动词，后面跟宾语时必须加介词to。

9. ✅ **Listen!**  
   **解析**：listen作为不及物动词可以单独使用，不需要介词。

10. ✅ **What are you thinking about?**  
    **解析**：疑问词应该放在句首，介词about放在句末。

11. ✅ **He gave it to you.**  
    **解析**：give的正确语序：give + 间接宾语 + 直接宾语 或 give + 直接宾语 + to + 间接宾语。

12. ✅ **Who did you buy it for? 或 For whom did you buy it?**  
    **解析**：buy sth for sb的结构，疑问句应该问"为谁买"。

13. ✅ **I'd like him to explain his decision to us.**  
    **解析**：explain sth to sb的结构，不能说explain sb sth。

14. ✅ **Can you suggest a good dentist to me?**  
    **解析**：suggest sth to sb的结构，不能说suggest sb sth。

15. ✅ **Please describe your wife to us.**  
    **解析**：describe sth to sb的结构，不能说describe sb sth。

16. ✅ **Sing to us. 或 Sing us a song.**  
    **解析**：sing可以是sing to sb或sing sb sth，但不能单独说sing us。

17. ✅ **He painted the wall red.**  
    **解析**：paint sth + 颜色，形容词作宾语补足语要放在宾语后面。

18. ✅ **She made it clear that she disagreed.**  
    **解析**：make it clear that...的结构，it是形式宾语。

19. ✅ **You surprised me!**  
    **解析**：surprise是及物动词，需要宾语。

20. ✅ **Do sit in that chair. 或 Do sit on that chair.**  
    **解析**：sit需要介词，坐在椅子上用in或on。

21. ✅ **The problem appears impossible.**  
    **解析**：appear是连系动词，后面跟形容词，不是副词。

22. ✅ **Isabel suddenly appeared in the doorway.**  
    **解析**：修饰动词要用副词suddenly，不是形容词sudden。

23. ✅ **He fell unconscious on the floor.**  
    **解析**：fall是连系动词，后面跟形容词unconscious，不是副词。

24. ✅ **He pulled his belt tight and started off.**  
    **解析**：pull sth tight，形容词tight作宾语补足语。

25. ✅ **She danced across the garden.**  
    **解析**：dancing作为方式状语不合适，应该把dance作为动词。
