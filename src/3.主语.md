# 主语

## 1.主语的成分
1. <u>She</u> is a teacher.
2. <u>Her job</u> is to teach English.
3. <u>Helping you learn English well</u>is her task.
4. <u>That she will quit her job as an English teacher</u> has upset every one of us.  
    上面句子表明能做主语的成分有: 代词, 名词, 非谓语动词和从句.  
    试着翻译下面的句子:  
    帅气和强壮是他的特点  
    错误: Handsome and strong are his character.  
    分析: 形容词不能作主语, 因此可以将形容词变为名词或在句子前加 being.  
    正确:  
    1. Handsomeness and strength are his character.  
    2. Being handsome and strong is his character.

## 2.没有主语怎么办
1. there be 句型  
   她的包里有一封情书  
   There is a love letter in her bag.  
   一年有四个季节  
   There are four seasons in a year.
2. it 作形式主语  
   机舱里很闷  
   It is stuffy in the cabin.  
   此时的北京很冷  
   It is cold in Beijing now.
3. 被动  
   必须指出坚持是成功的必备因素  
   最好不要译为: We must point out that persistence is essential to success.  
   而是译为: Persistence must be pointed out to be essential to success.
4. 人称代词
   只有当 there be, it, 被动行不通时才考虑加人称代词作主语.如:  
   上学: I/You/We go to school.  
   我们都同意他的观点: We all agree with his idea.
