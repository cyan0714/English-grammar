# 主语

## 1.主语的成分
1. <u>She</u> is a teacher.
2. <u>Her job</u> is to teach English.
3. <u>Helping you learn English well</u>is her task.
4. <u>That she will quit her job as an English teacher</u>has upset every one of us.  
    上面句子表明能做主语的成分有: 代词, 名词, 非谓语动词和从句.  
    试着翻译下面的句子:  
    帅气和强壮是他的特点  
    错误: Handsome and strong are his character.  
    分析: 形容词不能作主语, 因此可以将形容词变为名词或在句子前加 being.  
    正确:  
    1. Handsomeness and strength are his character.  
    2. Being handsome and strong is his character.
