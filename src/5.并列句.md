# 并列句

## 1. 什么是并列句
例子: I like learning English, I don't like mathematics  
以上句子严格按照语法来说是错的, 英语中不能用逗号连接两个句子, 以下方法才是正确的:  
1. 用并列连词连接两个分句:  
   I like learning English, but I don't like mathematics.  
2. 把不重要的句子变为从句, 重要的变为主句:  
   Although I like learning English, I don't like mathematics.  
3. 独立主格:  
   Liking learning English, I don't like methematics.  

再来两个例子加深印象:  
1. He always works hard at everything, so my mother asks me to learn from him.  
   so 为并列连词, 连接两个简单句
2. My uncle says (that) he has served here for twenty years and that he is going to retire next month.  
   and 是并列连词, 连接两个由 that 引导的宾语从句, 第一个 that 可以省略, 第二个不能省略
  
## 2. 连词分类及区别
1. 常见的并列连词  
   1. 平行关系: and, not only... but also..., both... and..., neither... nor...
   2. 转折关系: but, while, yet, whereas
   3. 选择关系: or, whether... or not..., either... or... 
   4. 因果关系: because, since, for, so
2. 表示逻辑关系的其他词(副词和介词短语)
   1. 平行关系: equally, similarly, likewise, simultaneously, at the same time, in the meanwhile
   2. 递进关系: then, also, besides, furthermore, moreover, additionally, subsequently, in addition
   3. 转折关系: however, on the contrary, by contrast, on the other hand
   4. 选择关系: alternatively
   5. 因果关系:  
      因为: because of, be responsible for, due to, owing to, thanks to.
      所以: thus, hence, consequently, therefore, as a result, as a consequence
   6. 总结关系: all in all, overall, in conclusion, generally, in a word, to conclude
   

   认真比较以下两组句子:  
   1. He failed many times, but he didn't despair.  
   或 He failed many times but he didn't despair.
   2. He failed many times. On the contrary, he didn't despair.  或 He failed many times, and on the contrary, he didn't despair.

    总结:   
      1. 当使用连词时, 连词前有无逗号均可.   
      2. 当使用其他的逻辑关系词时, 前面要么用句号, 要么只能加连词 and.
