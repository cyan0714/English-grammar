# 并列句

## 1. 什么是并列句
例子: I like learning English, I don't like mathematics  
以上句子严格按照语法来说是错的, 英语中不能用逗号连接两个句子, 以下方法才是正确的:  
1. 用并列连词连接两个分句:  
   I like learning English, but I don't like mathematics.  
2. 把不重要的句子变为从句, 重要的变为主句:  
   Although I like learning English, I don't like mathematics.  
3. 独立主格:  
   Liking learning English, I don't like methematics.  

再来两个例子加深印象:  
1. He always works hard at everything, so my mother asks me to learn from him.  
   so 为并列连词, 连接两个简单句
2. My uncle says (that) he has served here for twenty years and that he is going to retire next month.  
   and 是并列连词, 连接两个由 that 引导的宾语从句, 第一个 that 可以省略, 第二个不能省略
